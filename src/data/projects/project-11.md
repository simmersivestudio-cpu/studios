        Over the past five years, I have traveled to various U.S. government facilities to film and produce a wide range of promotional and training videos. During this time, I developed skills in motion graphics and video production, including filming with the Sony A7III for both video and photography.

        My work with U.S. Customs and Border Protection involved creating engaging motion graphics that effectively communicated complex operational procedures and organizational values. Using Adobe After Effects and Premiere Pro, I developed animated sequences that transformed technical information into visually compelling narratives for both internal training and public outreach initiatives.

        Throughout this multi-year engagement, I conducted on-site filming at secure government facilities across the country, managing all aspects of video production from pre-production planning and storyboarding to post-production editing. This experience strengthened my ability to work in high-security environments while delivering professional-quality content under strict deadlines and compliance requirements.
