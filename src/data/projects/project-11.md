        My work with U.S. Customs and Border Protection involved creating engaging motion graphics that effectively communicated complex operational procedures and organizational values. Using Adobe After Effects and Premiere Pro, I developed animated sequences that transformed technical information into visually compelling narratives for both internal training and public outreach initiatives.

    content: "
        Throughout this multi-year engagement, I conducted on-site filming at secure government facilities across the country, managing all aspects of video production from pre-production planning and storyboarding to post-production editing. This experience strengthened my ability to work in high-security environments while delivering professional-quality content under strict deadlines and compliance requirements.
