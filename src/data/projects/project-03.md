        The CIA Museum Store Collection by Studio S celebrates the rich legacy, innovation, and spirit of American intelligence through thoughtfully designed collectibles and museum-quality gift items.


         Each product transforms history into art — from CIA Headquarters architectural posters and portraits of past Directors in collectible postcard form, to holiday ornaments, wrapping papers, and commemorative retirement frames that honor service and heritage.  
        

        Every piece is created with the same precision and integrity that define the Agency itself — blending artistic craftsmanship, storytelling, and design excellence.
        

        Our goal is to bring meaningful, timeless keepsakes to the museum store — items that inspire pride, curiosity, and connection to the extraordinary world of intelligence.
