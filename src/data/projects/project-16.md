        My long-term professional goal is an ambitious one: to create art that brings out the spirituality of objects, using computer programs as my paintbrush and computer screens as my canvas. This thesis project represents my first exploration of Kandinsky's philosophy using modern 3D imaging tools to conjure feelings and thoughts through abstract 3D images, moving beyond recognizable characters and objects that dominate today's computer-generated art.

    heading: "Kandinsky's Philosophy in Digital Form"
    content: "
        As we move into the digital world, much of computer imaging and animation relies on recognizable characters and objects, especially in today's computer-generated television shows and movies. Following Kandinsky's understanding that art can invoke feelings and thoughts not formally dependent on representational objects, I use modern 3D imaging tools to create abstract images that conjure emotions through non-representational forms, colors, and movements.

    heading: "Abstract Spirituality Through Technology"
    content: "
        This thesis project pushes 3D computer-generated art beyond conventional representation, using abstract objects and color to represent the spirituality of real objects. Few viewers will recognize what the actual source object is, but everyone will sense the spirit of the source through its abstract structures, colors, shapes, and movement across the screen. This approach continues Kandinsky's philosophy while embracing today's advanced digital tools.

    heading: "Pioneering Digital Abstract Expression"
    content: "
        This thesis represents my first exploration of merging Kandinsky's abstract expressionist philosophy with cutting-edge 3D computer technology. Selected for the First Beijing International New Media Arts Exhibition (2004) and included in SVA's MFA Computer Art Selected Student Works DVD, this work established a foundation for continuing to expand my artistic vision, where many more explorations will emerge as I develop my learning and experiences in digital spiritual expression.
